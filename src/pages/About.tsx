            <p className="mb-6">
              Hirtoli Driving School was established in 2010 with a mission to provide high-quality driver education
              to all Ethiopians. Starting with a single location in Addis Ababa, we have grown to multiple branches
              across the country.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Our name "Hirtoli" represents our commitment to creating safe, confident, and skilled drivers who
              contribute to road safety in Ethiopia and beyond. The word combines "Hirta" (guidance) and "Oli" (path),
              symbolizing our role in guiding drivers safely on their journey.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-10">
              Over the years, we have continually updated our teaching methods, facilities, and vehicle fleet to 
              ensure we provide the most relevant and effective driver education possible. Our instructors undergo 
              regular training and certification to maintain the highest standards of instruction.

              reducing road accidents and promoting road safety culture across Ethiopia.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-10">
              We believe that safe driving is not just about passing a test but developing a mindset of responsibility 
              and awareness. We instill these values in all our students, ensuring they become drivers who prioritize 
              safety for themselves and others on the road.
